`mulle-objc-list` is a [mulle-objc](//github.com/mulle-objc) tool.
It's useful when developing mulle-objc projects. It loads a shared library and
dumps the mulle-objc load information contained within, for instance classes
or categories. The output is as [CSV, euro-style](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).
